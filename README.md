# nnCartoonifier

A neural network which converts images into cartoons. Admittedly, these look less like cartoons and more like portraits from a great artist!

# Dataset and training
Unlike the usual scenario, here the dataset was generated using a python script. Real images were input into the program and outputs were
obtained as shown below. These input-output pairs were then used to train the neural network. The goal was to have the neural network learn
the functionality of the program.

The model does not replicate the program output perfectly, and the end result is a portrait-like rendering of the input image rather than a
cartoonification.
